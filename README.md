In decreasing order of time investment.

naughts_and_crosses_ai is a genetic algorithm that learns to play naughts and crosses significantly better than bots playing at random. With the example hyperparameters, its win:loss ratio against a blind bot settles around 2.5:1. It simulates a population playing against itself and reproducing acording to individual success in the game. It is not intended to be the most efficient way to code a naughts and crosses bot.

nnbackprop implements the backpropogation algorithm on an arbitrary neural network.

animation.py simulates and animates charged particles' interractions due to Coulomb's law. It was my 'Hello World' animation.

bombmanual is a tool to play 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes', which I play with my younger sister. She reads out letters six at a time and I determine the unique word that can be built from them.
